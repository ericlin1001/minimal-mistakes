{% include JB/setup %}

To use function:sort in <algorithm>, be careful the compare function, it must stafisfy the following condtions:
Strick weak ordering:
* For all a, comp(a,a)==false
* if comp(a,b)==true, then comp(b,a)==false
* if comp(a,b)==true and comp(b,c)==true then comp(a,c)==true.

There is subtle case, extracted from a project.
